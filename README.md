### Notes
One challenge I encountered while building the app was installing CocoaPods. I kept getting an error while trying to install it and was stuck with that problem for quite some time. However, after going to the slack channel for help, I saw that someone else had the same problem and the reply they received from a TA also helped solve my issue.
